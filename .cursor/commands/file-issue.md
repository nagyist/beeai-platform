# File Issue in GitHub

## Overview

The goal is to draft GitHub ticket as a markdown that can be copy pasted.

If avaialble use Github MCP.

## Workflow

When filing issues to i-am-bee/agentstack:

1. Read appropriate template from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` first:
   - `bug_report.md` for bugs
   - `feature_request.md` for features

2. Follow template structure exactly

3. Ask the user to specify if something is unclear based on the template and their initial prompt.

4. If available use Github MCP to search duplicates

5. Before filing the ticket in github show the full ticket that you are about to file to have it confirmed by the user. Show this as a markdown.

6. Once user is happy, you can either submit the ticket if GH MCP is available otherwise dump as markdown.

## Rules

- Keep the ticket extremely concise
- Don't provide implementation details. Your goal is to define the problem and its potential consequences, not to propose a solution.
