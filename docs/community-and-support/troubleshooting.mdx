Having issues with BeeAI? Here are the most common fixes:

## Quick Fixes

### Restart the Platform
```bash
beeai platform stop
beeai platform start
```

### Update to Latest Version
Make sure you have the latest version:
```bash
uv tool install --force beeai-cli
beeai platform start
```

### Check Your LLM Setup
Agents need LLM configuration to work:
```bash
beeai model setup
```

### Using Ollama? Pull Your Model
If using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), make sure it's installed and the model is pulled:
```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

### Advanced debugging
You can inspect the agent logs and events using `beeai logs <agent-name>` or you can access the kubernetes
cluster directly using `beeai platform exec`, for example:

```bash
# List running pods
beeai platform exec kubectl get pod

# Get server logs
beeai platform exec kubectl logs svc/beeai-platform-svc

# Inspect cluster using GUI
export KUBECONFIG=~/.beeai/lima/beeai-platform/copied-from-guest/kubeconfig.yaml
k9s
```
