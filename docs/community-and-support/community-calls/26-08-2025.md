## üöÄ Major Achievement: Full A2A Protocol Migration

We've successfully migrated from ACP to A2A protocol, making BeeAI Platform the simple way to build A2A compatible agents.

### Key Changes

- All core agents migrated to A2A protocol
- Updated UI components to work with A2A message structure
- Improved error handling and streaming capabilities
- Better developer experience with new SDK patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Platform Improvements

### User Feedback System
**New thumbs up/down rating system for agent responses**

Users can now:
- Rate agent responses with ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚¨áÔ∏è buttons
- Provide detailed feedback with categories
- Help improve agents through structured comments

### RAG Agent & Enhanced File Support
**First-class support for document-based workflows**

- New RAG agent implementation
- Upload documents and extract content automatically
- Query documents via embeddings through platform API
- Support for multiple file formats

### Context Scoped Resources & Token System
**Enhanced security and resource isolation**

Major new feature for enterprise and multi-user scenarios:
- Context Management: Files and vector stores now scoped to contexts
- Context Tokens: Fine-grained permission system for secure resource access
- Isolation: Users can only access resources within their permitted contexts
- Token Permissions: Separate global and context-level permission grants

## üîß Developer Experience

### BeeAI SDK
**Comprehensive SDK for A2A agent development**

New extensions and services:
- **LLM Service Extension**: Enhanced language model integration
- **Embedding Service Extension**: Vector operations and similarity search
- **Citation & Trajectory Extensions**: Better result tracking and sourcing
- **MCP Extension**: Model Context Protocol support
- **Platform Client**: Simplified API interactions

### Separate LLM & Embedding Providers
**Independent configuration for maximum flexibility**

Through the `beeai model setup` CLI flow:
- Select your preferred LLM provider
- Choose a separate embedding provider
- Optimize costs and performance independently
