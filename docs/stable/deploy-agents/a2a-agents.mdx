Got an existing A2A agent that is not wrapped using Agent Stack SDK? No problem, you can still connect it to Agent Stack by providing a Docker image or its running URL.

## Add Docker A2A Agent

When you want your agent to be managed via Agent Stack, provide a Docker image:

```bash
agentstack add <docker-image-url>
```

For example:
```bash
agentstack add ghcr.io/my-org/my-agent:latest
```

### Requirements

Your A2A agent Docker image must:

1. **Expose a valid agent card** at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`
2. **Start without required environment variables** — Agent Stack temporarily runs the container to extract metadata, then terminates it. Your image must be able to start with sensible defaults (no mandatory env vars).

### How It Works

When you register an A2A agent:

1. Agent Stack pulls and starts your Docker image
2. Probes `/.well-known/agent-card.json` to extract agent metadata
3. Terminates the container
4. Uses the metadata to make the agent available in the interface

When users interact with your agent, Agent Stack manages the container lifecycle automatically.

## Add Unmanaged A2A Agent

<Tip>
An **unmanaged agent** is an A2A agent whose lifecycle is not controlled by Agent Stack. You are responsible for starting, stopping, and maintaining it. Agent Stack only proxies requests to it.
</Tip>

If your A2A agent is already running and you don't want Agent Stack to manage its lifecycle (unmanaged), you can add it directly via its URL:

```bash
agentstack add <agent-url>
```

For example:
```bash
agentstack add http://localhost:8080
```

### Requirements

Your running A2A agent must expose a valid agent card at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`. For the example above, this would be at `http://localhost:8080/.well-known/agent-card.json`.

### How It Works

When you register an unmanaged A2A agent, Agent Stack fetches the agent card from the `/.well-known/agent-card.json` endpoint of the provided URL. It then enhances the metadata from the card to make the agent available in the interface.

Agent Stack will not manage the lifecycle of this agent. When users interact with it, requests are proxied to the provided agent URL.
