title: "Build New Agents"
description: "Start building your own agent with a simple Hello World example"
---

To help you get started quickly, we’ve created a ready-to-use starter repository. The starter repo provides you basic scaffolding, a GitHub workflow, and a Dockerfile.
You can clone it and start coding right away—no setup headaches or boilerplate required. Then customize the agent with your own logic.

## Prerequisites

- Agent Stack installed ([Quickstart](../introduction/quickstart)) and the platform running with `agentstack platform start`
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (should be already installed if you followed the quickstart)

## 1.  Start From Template

<Steps>
<Step title="Use the Official Starter Template">
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Clone directly">
```bash
git clone https://github.com/i-am-bee/agentstack-starter my-agent
cd my-agent
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Use as a GitHub template">
1. Go to the [template repository](https://github.com/i-am-bee/agentstack-starter)
2. Click "Use this template" → "Create a new repository"
3. Clone your new repository locally
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>

<Step title="Run the Server and Autoregister with Agent Stack">

```bash
uv run server
```

<Tip>
**Enable auto-reload during development:** Add `watchfiles` to automatically restart your server when code changes:
```bash
uv run watchfiles agentstack_agents.agent.run
```
</Tip>

</Step>
<Step title="Run Your Agent">

In another terminal:

```bash
agentstack run example_agent "Alice"
```
</Step>
</Steps>

You should see: "Ciao Alice!" 🎉

With your first agent running, you can now modify it to do anything you want.

## 2. Implement Your Agent Logic

In the starter repo, navigate to [src/agentstack_agents/agent.py](https://github.com/i-am-bee/agentstack-starter/blob/main/src/agentstack_agents/agent.py) and replace the example with your agent logic.

The starter example is minimal and intended for demonstration purposes only:

```python
import os

from a2a.types import (
    Message,
)
from a2a.utils.message import get_message_text
from agentstack_sdk.server import Server
from agentstack_sdk.server.context import RunContext
from agentstack_sdk.a2a.types import AgentMessage

server = Server()

@server.agent()
async def example_agent(input: Message, context: RunContext):
    """Polite agent that greets the user"""
    hello_template: str = os.getenv("HELLO_TEMPLATE", "Ciao %s!")
    yield AgentMessage(text=hello_template % get_message_text(input))

def run():
    server.run(host=os.getenv("HOST", "127.0.0.1"), port=int(os.getenv("PORT", 8000)))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

<Steps title="Building Your First Agent: Step-by-Step">

<Step title="Start and Configure the Server">
An agent is essentially an HTTP server. Use `server.run()` to define how your agent listens for requests:
- Host: Defaults to `127.0.0.1` (localhost).
- Port: Defaults to `8000`. If you run multiple agents on the same machine, ensure each has a unique port.

</Step>

<Step title="Mark Your Agent Function">
Add the `@server.agent` decorator to your function so the platform recognizes it as an agent.
</Step>

<Step title="Name and Describe Your Agent">
- Identity: The function name (e.g., example_agent) becomes the agent’s unique identifier. 
- Metadata: Write a clear docstring. The SDK extracts this text to serve as the agent’s description in UIs and registries, helping understand what your agent does.
</Step>

<Step title="Understand the Function Arguments">
- First argument: An [A2A `Message`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#64-message-object). Use `get_message_text(input)` to pull the raw string from the user. This is where you would typically pass data into your LLM or custom processing logic.
- Second argument: A `RunContext` object with run details provides metadata about the current execution (e.g., `task_id`, `context_id`). Use this if your agent logic needs to track session state or reference specific task parameters.
</Step>

<Step title="Stream Responses via Async Generator">
Agents should be async and use `yield`. This allows the server to stream responses back to the client in real time. Yield an `AgentMessage` (a handy wrapper around A2A Message) for convenience or a plain `str`, which will be automatically converted into an A2A Message.
</Step>

</Steps>

<Accordion title="Manual Project Configuration">

If you prefer not to use our starter template, you must ensure your project includes these core components to integrate correctly with the Agent Stack platform.
- The SDK Inegration
    - Add agentstack-sdk to your project dependencies.
    - Your code must initialize a Server() instance from the SDK.
    - You need a designated function that calls server.run(host, port). This is what allows the platform (and Docker) to start your agent.
- Agent logic remains the same as in the [Implement Your Agent Logic](#2-implement-your-agent-logic) section
- Containerization Requirements
    - If you plan to deploy your agent to the platform (rather than just running it locally), your repository must contain a `Dockerfile`
- Git and Platform Metadata
    - The repository must be accessible to the Agent Stack orchestrator if you are using the `agentstack add` command via URL.
    - Use Git tags (e.g., v1.0.0) if you want to manage stable releases of your agent.
