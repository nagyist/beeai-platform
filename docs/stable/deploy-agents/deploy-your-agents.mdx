description: "Package and deploy your agent to Agent Stack as a managed service"
---

Once you've wrapped your agent with the Agent Stack server, you need to containerize it and deploy it, so that Agent Stack can run it as a managed service.

## Prerequisites
- Agent Stack installed ([Quickstart](/stable/introduction/quickstart))
- Agent wrapped with Agent Stack SDK ([Wrap Existing Agents](/stable/deploy-agents/wrap-existing-agents) or [Build New Agent](/stable/deploy-agents/building-agents))

## Agent Deploy Process

To deploy your agent to Agent Stack, you need to create a github repository with your agent and then deploy from that repository to Agent Stack.

### 1. Create an Agent github repository

You can quickly create an agent repository by using the Agent Stack starter template. The [agentstack-starter template](https://github.com/i-am-bee/agentstack-starter) includes everything you need:
- Production-ready Dockerfile
- GitHub Actions for automated builds
- Agent Stack deployment configuration

Clone it and modify it for your agent as follows:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/i-am-bee/agentstack-starter my-agent
cd my-agent
# Replace the example agent with your code
```

Alternatively, if you want to start from scratch, you can create your own github repository. You will need to include a `Dockerfile` with the following information:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim-trixie
COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.7.15 /uv /bin/

ENV UV_LINK_MODE=copy \
    PRODUCTION_MODE=true

ADD . /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN uv sync --no-cache --locked --link-mode copy

ENV PRODUCTION_MODE=true \
    PATH="/app/.venv/bin:$PATH" \
    HOME=/tmp

CMD ["uv", "run", "--no-sync", "server"]
```

### 2. Deploy your Agent to Agent Stack

To deploy from your my-agent github repo, run the following with your organization name substituted for myorg:
```bash
agentstack add https://github.com/myorg/my-agent
```

This command automatically:
1. ✓ Builds your Docker image from github using the provided Dockerfile in the github root directory
2. ✓ Copies the image into Agent Stack's VM
3. ✓ Registers it as an available agent

As a specific example, to deploy the agentstack-starter example agent without modification, you can issue the following command:

```bash
agentstack add https://github.com/i-am-bee/agentstack-starter
```

<Note>
**Why "copy into VM"?** Agent Stack runs in an isolated VM (Lima on Mac/Linux, WSL on Windows). Even though Docker Desktop builds your image, Agent Stack needs it copied into its VM to run it. The `add` command handles this automatically.
</Note>

## Github Deploy Options
The `agentstack add` command supports various URL formats to specify the repository, version, and location of your agent's code.

The supported formats include:
- **Basic URL**: `https://github.com/myorg/myrepo`
- **Git Protocol URL**: `git+https://github.com/myorg/myrepo`
- **URL with .git suffix**: `https://github.com/myorg/myrepo.git`
- **URL with Version Tag**: `https://github.com/myorg/myrepo@v1.0.0`
- **URL with Branch Name**: `https://github.com/myorg/myrepo@my-branch`
- **URL with Subfolder Path**: `https://github.com/myorg/myrepo#path=/path/to/agent`
- **Combined Formats**: `https://github.com/myorg/myrepo.git@v1.0.0#path=/path/to/agent`
- **Enterprise GitHub**: `https://github.mycompany.com/myorg/myrepo`

#### Example

To deploy an agent from a specific branch and subfolder, you would run:
```bash
agentstack add "https://github.com/my-org/my-awesome-agents@main#path=/my-agent"
```

This command tells Agent Stack to:
1. Fetch the `main` branch of the `my-awesome-agents` repository.
2. Look for the agent's `Dockerfile` and source code in the `/my-agent` directory.
3. Build the Docker image and register it with the platform.

### Verify Deployment

You can check that your agent is registered by running:
```bash
agentstack list
```

Your agent should appear in the list with status information.

## Test Your Agent

Test via CLI:
```bash
agentstack run my-agent "Hello!"
```

Or open the web UI:
```bash
agentstack ui
```

Your agent will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8333`

## Advanced Options

### Two-step build process
If you need more control over the build:
```bash
# Step 1: Build and copy to Agent Stack VM
agentstack build https://github.com/myorg/myrepo

# Step 2: Register the agent
agentstack add agentstack.local/my-agent-abc123:latest
```
