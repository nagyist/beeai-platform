## Prerequisites

- Basic terminal/command line experience  
- LLM API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, watsonx, or free via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) / [Groq](https://groq.com/)) or [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (requires a powerful computer)  
- Fast internet (2–3GB download)  

## Installation

<Tab title="Linux & macOS">

## One-Line Install

Open the terminal and run this command to install Agent Stack:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i-am-bee/agentstack/install/install.sh)"
```

<Info> 

The installer sets up `uv` and the `agentstack-cli` on your host machine. Agent Stack uses a virtual machine (managed via a bundled [Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima) binary) to keep your host machine clean. The Kubernetes cluster running the Agent Stack server, agent containers, and associated storage and services live entirely inside the VM and not on your host directly. 


For details on what happens under the hood, refer to the Manual Install section or read the [`install.sh`](https://github.com/i-am-bee/agentstack/blob/install/install.sh) source code.

</Info>

<Accordion title="Manual Install">

<Steps>
<Step title="Install uv">

Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). Agent Stack uses `uv` to manage its own internal Python environment.

</Step>
<Step title="Linux only: Install QEMU">

On Linux, Lima requires QEMU. Install it via these ([instructions](https://www.qemu.org/download/)).

</Step>
<Step title="Install Agent Stack">

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
uv python install --quiet --python-preference=only-managed --no-bin 3.13 && uv tool install --refresh --force --python-preference=only-managed --python=3.13 agentstack-cli && agentstack self install
```

Follow the interactive prompts to finish setup and optionally start the VM.

</Step>

</Tab>
<Tab title="Windows">

<Note>
Windows support is experimental and requires Windows 11 22H2 or later. For the best experience, we recommend Linux or macOS.
</Note>

<Steps>
<Step title="Install WSL">

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
wsl.exe --update
```

Follow the instructions displayed, if any, and continue by running:

```powershell
wsl.exe --install
```

The command output may instruct you to restart your PC. Do so, and afterwards run the same command again. It may take up to two restarts to complete the installation process.

WSL is properly set up once you reach a working Linux shell. You can verify this by running `wsl.exe` without arguments. Once you have a working shell, you can close it and proceed to the next step.

<Warning>

Even though WSL2 is required, Agent Stack CLI can't be installed _inside_ WSL2. All subsequent commands should be run from Windows PowerShell.

</Warning>

</Step>
<Step title="Install uv">

Open PowerShell and run:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Installation script (recommended)">

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Winget">

```bash
winget install astral-sh.uv
uv tool update-shell
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Scoop">

```bash
scoop install uv
uv tool update-shell
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Chocolatey">

```bash
choco install uv
uv tool update-shell
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Close and reopen your terminal after installation.

</Step>
<Step title="Configure Ollama (optional)">

If you plan to use Ollama, we recommend installing the [Windows app](https://ollama.com/download/windows).

In the Ollama app settings, it's necessary to enable *"Expose Ollama to the network"* in order for it to be accessible by Agent Stack. After enabling this option, you may get a firewall prompt where you need to select *"Allow"*.

</Step>
<Step title="Configure local agents">

Run in PowerShell:

```bash
setx HOST 0.0.0.0
```

Close and reopen your terminal after this.

<Info>

This will make local agents accessible over the local network, which is needed for Agent Stack to access them. When running local agents, you may encounter firewall prompts where you need to select *"Allow"*.

</Info>

</Step>
<Step title="Install Agent Stack">

Run in PowerShell:

```bash
uv python install --quiet --python-preference=only-managed --no-bin 3.13; uv tool install --refresh --force --python-preference=only-managed --python=3.13 agentstack-cli; agentstack self install
```

Follow the interactive prompts to finish the installation and setup.

## Usage

```sh
agentstack ui                          # Launch web interface
agentstack list                        # See what agents are available
agentstack run chat "Hi, who are you"  # Send a message to chat agent
agentstack run chat                    # Try interactive mode
agentstack info chat                   # View agent details
agentstack --help                      # See all options
```

## Platform Management

```sh
agentstack platform start        # Start platform
agentstack model setup           # Configure LLM provider
agentstack platform stop         # Stop (keeps data)
agentstack platform delete       # Delete all data
```

## Version & Upgrades

<Warning>
If you are having issues with these commands, you may be running an old version of Agent Stack. Run the one-line install script above to upgrade to the latest version.
</Warning>

```sh
agentstack self version          # Check version
agentstack self upgrade          # Update
agentstack self uninstall        # Remove completely
```
