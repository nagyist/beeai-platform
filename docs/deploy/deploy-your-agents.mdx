Once you've wrapped your agent with the Agent Stack server, you need to containerize it so Agent Stack can run it as a managed service.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running (or use GitHub Actions via template)
- Agent wrapped with Agent Stack SDK ([Wrap Existing Agents](/deploy/wrap-existing-agent) or [Build New Agent](/deploy/build-new-agent))
- Agent Stack installed ([Quickstart](/introduction/quickstart))

## Containerize Your Agent

### Option 1: Use the Starter Template (Recommended)

The [agentstack-starter template](https://github.com/i-am-bee/agentstack-starter) includes everything you need:
- Production-ready Dockerfile
- GitHub Actions for automated builds
- Agent Stack deployment configuration

Clone it and modify for your agent:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/i-am-bee/agentstack-starter my-agent
cd my-agent
# Replace the example agent with your code
```

<Tip>
You can push your repository to GitHub and tag it to leverage the automated GitHub workflow to build the image directly in GitHub, without running Docker locally.
</Tip>

### Option 2: Create Your Own Dockerfile

If you're starting from scratch, create a `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy agent code
COPY . .

# Configure server
ENV HOST=0.0.0.0
ENV PORT=10000
EXPOSE 10000

# Run agent server
CMD ["python", "server.py"]
```

<Note>
**Port Configuration:** The SDK defaults to port 10000. Make sure your Dockerfile `EXPOSE` and `ENV PORT` match, and that your `server.run()` call uses the same port via environment variable.
</Note>

## Deploy to Agent Stack

### One-Command Deployment

From your agent directory, run:
```bash
agentstack add .
```

This automatically:
1. ✓ Builds your Docker image locally
2. ✓ Copies the image into Agent Stack's VM
3. ✓ Registers it as an available agent

<Note>
**Why "copy into VM"?** Agent Stack runs in an isolated VM (Lima on Mac/Linux, WSL on Windows). Even though Docker Desktop builds your image, Agent Stack needs it copied into its VM to run it. The `add` command handles this automatically.
</Note>

### Verify Deployment

Check that your agent is registered:
```bash
agentstack list
```

Your agent should appear in the list with status information.

### Test Your Agent

Test via CLI:
```bash
agentstack run my-agent "Hello!"
```

Or open the web UI:
```bash
agentstack ui
```

Your agent will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8333`

## Advanced Options

<Accordion title="Two-step build process">
If you need more control over the build:
```bash
# Step 1: Build and copy to Agent Stack VM
agentstack build . --import

# Step 2: Register the agent
agentstack add agentstack.local/my-agent-abc123:latest
```

The `--import` flag (enabled by default) copies your Docker image from Docker Desktop into Agent Stack's VM.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build without importing">
Test your Dockerfile builds without deploying:
```bash
agentstack build . --no-import
```

This creates the image in Docker Desktop but doesn't copy it to Agent Stack. Useful for testing or if you plan to push to a registry instead.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Custom build options">
```bash
# Custom image tag
agentstack build . --tag my-agent:v1.0.0 --import

# Build for multiple architectures
agentstack build . --multi-platform --import

# Use custom Dockerfile location
agentstack build . --dockerfile=./deploy/Containerfile --import
```
</Accordion>
