</Info>

BeeAI is an open-source platform that makes it easy to **discover**, **run**, and **share** AI agents across frameworks. Built on the [Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A) and hosted by the Linux Foundation, BeeAI bridges the gap between different agent ecosystems.

## The Problem BeeAI Solves

Teams building AI agents often run into three main challenges:
- **Framework Fragmentation:** Multiple frameworks lead to silos and duplicated work.
- **Deployment Complexity:** Each agent needs its own setup, slowing down scale.
- **Discovery Challenges:** Finding and reusing agents is hard without a central hub.

BeeAI provides a standardized platform to discover, run, and share agents from any framework.

## Key Features

| Feature | What it does |
| :------ | :----------- |
| **Instant web interface** | Spin up a shareable front-end in minutes‚Äîfocus on your agent, not UI frameworks. |
| **Complete infrastructure** | Deploy your agent container instantly, with database, storage, scaling, monitoring, plus MCP gateway and RAG services. |
| **Framework-agnostic** | Combine agents from BeeAI, LangChain, CrewAI, and more using A2A. |
| **Multi-provider playground** | Test agents across OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, IBM watsonx, Ollama, and others to compare performance and cost instantly. |

## How BeeAI Works

Run BeeAI locally, and your agents connect to the platform for discovery, testing, and sharing through a simple web interface.

You get:
- Access to ready-to-use agents from our official catalog  
- Easy testing across multiple LLM providers  
- Framework-agnostic development via the BeeAI SDK powered by A2A  
- Ready-made web interfaces for all your agents  

<Note>
Want to deploy BeeAI for your team? BeeAI can also run as a hosted platform with full Kubernetes infrastructure. Learn more about [platform deployment](/deployment/overview).
