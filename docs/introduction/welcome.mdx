Agent Stack is open, self-hostable infrastructure for deploying AI agents built with any framework. Hosted by the Linux Foundation and built on the [Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)](https://a2a-protocol.org/), it gives you everything needed to move agents from local development to shared production environments—without vendor lock-in.

## What Agent Stack Provides

Everything you need to deploy and operate agents in production:

- **Self-hostable server** to run your agents
- **Web UI** for testing and sharing deployed agents
- **CLI** for deploying and managing agents
- **Runtime services** your agents can access:
  - **LLM Service** — Switch between 15+ providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, watsonx.ai, Ollama) without code changes
  - **Embeddings & vector search** for RAG and semantic search
  - **File storage** — S3-compatible uploads/downloads
  - **Document text extraction** via [Docling](https://www.docling.ai/)
  - **External integrations** via MCP protocol (APIs, Slack, Google Drive, etc.) with OAuth
  - **Secrets management** for API keys and credentials
- **SDK (`agentstack-sdk`)** for standardized A2A service requests
- **HELM chart** for Kubernetes deployments with customizable storage, databases, and auth

Build your agent using LangGraph, CrewAI, or your own framework—SDK handles runtime service requests automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Build** your agent using `agentstack-sdk`
2. **Deploy** with a single CLI command
3. **Users interact** through the auto-generated web UI

Your agents request infrastructure services at runtime through A2A protocol extensions.

- **Development:** Run locally with full services for rapid iteration  
- **Production:** Deploy to Kubernetes via HELM and integrate with your infrastructure
