BeeAI can be installed and used locally through the BeeAI CLI. Internally, this creates an automatically managed virtual machine for running agents. We offer support for macOS, Linux and Windows.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="macOS">
<Warning>

BeeAI requires macOS 13 (Ventura) or later.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install uv">

If you don't have `uv` installed, install it using one of the supported ways.

Open a terminal and run:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Installation script (recommended)">

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Homebrew">

```bash
brew install uv
uv tool update-shell
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

After this, close the terminal and re-open it.

</Step>
<Step title="Install BeeAI">

```bash
uv tool install beeai-cli
```

</Step>
<Step title="Start the BeeAI platform">

```bash
beeai platform start
```

</Step>
<Step title="Configure an LLM provider">

BeeAI needs an LLM provider for the agents -- like OpenAI, Ollama, Anthropic, etc.

If you don't already have an API key for a provider, you can register for a free one on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

Run this command and follow the interactive prompts:

```bash
beeai model setup
```

<Tip>
You can re-run this command anytime to change the LLM provider.
</Tip>

</Step>
<Step title="Check that everything works">

```bash
beeai run chat Hi!
```

Starting up an agent for a first time may take a few minutes. If everything is succesful, you should see a friendly greeting from the agent.

✨ **Done!** You are ready to use the BeeAI platform.

<Tab title="Package manager">

Some Linux distributions package `uv`, but beware that some may include outdated versions.
Check the [Repology website](https://repology.org/project/uv/versions) to see if your distribution packages `uv`.
Alternatively, you may install `uv` using `pipx` or `cargo` according to the [official installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
If in doubt, just use the installation script.

After installing `uv`, run this to update your PATH:

```bash
uv tool update-shell
```

<Warning>

Windows support is currently experimental. We recommend running BeeAI on Linux or macOS instead.

<Info>

These steps guide you through installing BeeAI in PowerShell. If you wish, you may work in a WSL distribution instead. In that case, simply switch to the Linux instructions and skip installing QEMU.

Ensure that you are using **Windows 11 22H2** or newer.

<Step title="Upgrade BeeAI">

```bash
uv tool install --force beeai-cli
```

<Tip>
We recommend this command over `uv tool upgrade beeai-cli` to ensure that you always get the latest version. `uv tool upgrade` respects the original version constraint -- e.g. if you installed with `uv tool install beeai-cli==0.3.2`, `uv tool upgrade beeai-cli` will never upgrade to `0.3.3` or later.
