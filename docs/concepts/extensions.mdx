title: Platform Extensions
---

Platform extensions let agents access external services and UI components via dependency injection. They provide configured services automatically, make agents portable, support user-configured services, handle authentication, and remain optional.

## Extension Types

### Service Extensions

Provide access to external services with automatic configuration:

- **LLM Service**: Access to language models (OpenAI, Ollama, IBM Granite, etc.)
- **Embedding Service**: Text embedding generation for RAG and similarity search
- **Platform API**: File storage, vector databases, and platform services
- **MCP**: Integration with Model Context Protocol tools

### UI Extensions

Enhance the user interface with rich components:

- **Trajectory**: Step-by-step agent reasoning visualization
- **Citation**: Source references with clickable links
- **Form**: Interactive forms for structured user input

## Dependency Injection Pattern

Extensions are injected using `Annotated` type hints:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from beeai_sdk.a2a.extensions import LLMServiceExtensionServer, LLMServiceExtensionSpec

async def my_agent(
    input: Message,
    context: RunContext,
    llm: Annotated[LLMServiceExtensionServer, LLMServiceExtensionSpec.single_demand()]
):
    # Platform provides configured LLM access
    pass
```

## Extension Availability

Extensions are optional by design. Always check if provided:

```python
if llm:
    # Use LLM functionality
    pass
else:
    # Provide fallback or inform user
    yield "LLM not configured"
```

## Model Suggestions

Service extensions accept suggested models in preference order:

```python
LLMServiceExtensionSpec.single_demand(
    suggested=("openai/gpt-4o", "ollama/llama3.1", "ibm/granite-3-8b")
)
```

Platform selects the first available model from suggestions.

Extensions make agents adaptable to different deployment environments while providing rich user experiences.
