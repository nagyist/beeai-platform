Welcome! We’re so glad you’re here. Whether you're fixing a typo, filing a bug, or building something brand new, your contributions help shape Agent Stack into something better for everyone.


## What We Value & How We Work

Agent Stack is a Linux Foundation project. This means we are committed to a neutral, sustainable, and truly open ecosystem. Because we are a community-led project, our growth and success depend entirely on the people who use, test, and build it.
We care about:
- Making real problems easier to solve
- Sharing early and learning together
- Designing tools that are easy for others to build on
- Keeping interactions kind, intentional, and inclusive

We are async-friendly and value thoughtful collaboration. When contributing, keep these principles in mind:
- Share your progress early to get feedback before diving deep
- Focus on the problem you’re solving, not just the code
- Give thoughtful feedback and expect the same in return
- Prioritize clarity, empathy, and user impact

## How to Get Involved

You don’t need to be an AI expert to help. Here’s how you can make impact today:
- Use Agent Stack and tell us what works (and what doesn’t)
- Open an issue for bugs, questions, or new ideas
- Share feedback on discussions or pull requests
- Propose changes — small bug fixes are just as valuable as new features
- Improve docs by clarifying examples, fixing typos, or writing tutorials
