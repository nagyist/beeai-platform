Use the Agent Stack CLI to configure and manage remote Agent Stack deployments. Agent Stack follows a client-server architecture, where the CLI acts as a client connecting to a deployed Agent Stack server. This allows you to manage agents remotely from your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Agent Stack CLI installed locally ([Quickstart](/introduction/quickstart))
- URL of your deployed Agent Stack server
- Authentication credentials for the server

## Connect to a server

Run this command to connect to a remote server:

```bash
agentstack server login
```

The CLI will prompt you for:
- Server URL
- Authentication credentials

Once authenticated, the CLI connects to your specified server and saves the connection for future commands.

## View connected servers

List all servers you've connected to:

```bash
agentstack server list
```

This shows all saved server connections. The active server is marked in the output.

## Switch between servers

To switch to a different connected server:

```bash
agentstack server select
```

Select from your saved connections.

## Disconnect from a server

Remove the currently active server connection:

```bash
agentstack server logout
```

This removes the server from your saved connections. To disconnect from a different server, switch to it first, then logout.
