Got an existing A2A agent that is not wrapped using Agent Stack SDK? No problem, you can still connect it to Agent Stack by providing a Docker image.

## Add Your Agent

```bash
agentstack add <image-url>
```

For example:
```bash
agentstack add ghcr.io/my-org/my-agent:latest
```

## Requirements

Your A2A agent Docker image must:

1. **Expose a valid agent card** at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`
2. **Start without required environment variables** — Agent Stack temporarily runs the container to extract metadata, then terminates it. Your image must be able to start with sensible defaults (no mandatory env vars).

## How It Works

When you register an A2A agent:

1. Agent Stack pulls and starts your Docker image
2. Probes `/.well-known/agent-card.json` to extract agent metadata
3. Terminates the container
4. Uses the metadata to make the agent available in the interface

When users interact with your agent, Agent Stack manages the container lifecycle automatically.
