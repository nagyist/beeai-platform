BeeAI is an open-source platform that makes it easy to test, debug, and share AI agents in an interactive UI — with out-of-the-box trajectory, citations, and more.  

Built on the [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/) and hosted by the **Linux Foundation**, BeeAI bridges the gap between different agent ecosystems.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|:---------|:-------------|
| 🎯 Instant Agent UI | Generate a shareable front-end from your code in minutes. Focus on your agent's logic, not UI frameworks. |
| 🚀 Effortless Deployment | Go from container to production-ready. We handle database, storage, scaling, and RAG so you can focus on your agent. |
| 🔄 Multi-Provider Playground | Test across OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, IBM watsonx, Ollama and more. Instantly compare performance and cost to find the optimal model. |
| 🔧 Framework-Agnostic | Run agents from LangChain, CrewAI, BeeAI and more on a single platform. Enable cross-framework collaboration without rewriting your code. |

## Quickstart

### Installation

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

> [!TIP]
> The one-line script works on Linux and macOS. For manual setup or experimental Windows support, see the [quickstart guide](https://docs.beeai.dev/introduction/quickstart).

### Usage

```sh
beeai ui                     # Launch web interface
beeai list                   # See what agents are available
beeai run chat "Hi!"         # Send a message to chat agent
beeai run chat               # Try interactive mode
beeai info chat              # View agent details
beeai --help                 # See all options
```

### Build Your First Agent

```sh
git clone https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform-agent-starter my-agent
cd my-agent
uv run server               # Start your agent
```

Then in another terminal:
```sh
beeai run example_agent "Alice"  # Test your agent
```

You should see: "Ciao Alice!" 🎉

> [!TIP]
> Follow the [Hello World tutorial](https://docs.beeai.dev/build-agents/hello-world) for a step-by-step guide to building your first agent.

## Acknowledgements

BeeAI builds upon the foundations established by several pioneering projects in the agent and protocol ecosystem:

- [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/) - The open standard enabling cross-framework agent communication
- [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) - Advancing how AI models interact with context
- [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol) - Demonstrating the power of standardized tooling protocols
- [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) - The specification underlying modern RPC communication

We're grateful to these communities for advancing the state of agent infrastructure and interoperability.
